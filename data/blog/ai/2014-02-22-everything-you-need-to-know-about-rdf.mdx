Humans share, consume and produce knowledge using natural language; however presenting this knowledge in a machine readable and understandable format can be difficult. Lets take for example the fact that **I (Ahmad) have (owner of ) a blog (http://assaf.website/blog)**. In natural language i can easily express that. If i want to convert this into [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML 'XML') which is one of the most popular data representation (markup) language, i can have the following representations:

However, this doesn't come intuitively to humans as they are used to present statements generally in a systematic fashion of `Subject - Verb/Predicate/Action - Object `From this thought, the idea of presenting knowledge in a three parts form was the basis of the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), where i can represent the following example saying that:

```xml
<!-- Presentation Method (1) -->
<blog>
     <owner>Ahmad</owner>
     <address>http://assaf.website/blog</address>
</blog>
<!-- Presentation Method  (2)-->
<person name="Ahmad">
     <blog>http://assaf.website/blog</blog>
</person>
<!-- Presentation Method  (3)-->
<person name="Ahmad" blog="http://assaf.website/blog" />
```

This is an intuitive knowledge representation using directed graphs, where the subjects and objects are the nodes and the predicates are the edges of that graph. This statement that comprises of these three parts is called RDF-Triple where the resource is a URI or a blank (empty) node, the property is a URI and the object can be a URI, literal or a [Blank Node](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_node 'Blank node'). If we wish to transform this knowledge into the traditional relational model (tables) it will look like:

| **Subject** | **Predicate** |        **Object**         |
| :---------: | :-----------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Ahmad    |  has a blog   | http://assaf.website/blog |

# Constituents of an RDF Triple

## URIs

A Unique referenceable URI.  A [URI reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier 'Uniform resource identifier') is a Unicode string that does not contain any control characters and would produce a valid URI character sequence representing an absolute URI with optional [fragment identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier 'Fragment identifier') when subjected to the encoding that consists of:

- encoding the Unicode string as [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 'UTF-8') giving a sequence of octet values.
- %-escaping octets that do not correspond to permitted [US-ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII 'ASCII') characters.

## Literals

Simple Strings that describe data values that do not have a separate existence. They can be plain (simple string combined with an optional language tag) or typed (string combined with a datatype URI and an optional language tag). Typed Literals are expressed via the XML Schema data types. Whenever we are using URIs to describe things in RDF we try as much as we can to reuse existing namespaces and for literals we use the XML Schema defined in [http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#).  So for example if i want to define a literal as a [String](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_%28computer_science%29 'String (computer science)') i use the following syntax :

```
"Semantics"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#String>
```

We should note that literals are wrapped with quotations marks. The hash after the `XMLSchema` URI denotes the fragment identifier that points to String. In addition to these i can specify a language tag the describes the "natural" language of the text. For example, `"Semantic"@en` which means that this literal is an English world.

Literals are written either using double-quotes when they do not contain linebreaks like `"simple literal"` or `"long literal"` when they may contain linebreaks. Datatypes are a bit tricky. Let's think of the datatype for [floating-point numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point 'Floating point'). At an abstract level, the floating-point numbers themselves are different from the text we use to represent them on paper. For instance, the text “5.1” represents the number 5.1, but so does “5.1000” and “05.10”. Here there are multiple textual representations — what are called lexical representations — for the same value.

A datatype tells us how to map lexical representations to values, and vice versa. RDF reuses the `XML Schema (W3C)"` datatypes, including `xsd:string, xsd:float, xsd:double, xsd:integer, and xsd:date` RDF can also contain custom datatypes that (you guessed it!) are simply named with a URI. If you omit a datatype declaration it be considered as a plain literal by many RDF tools, **which is not the same thing as a string**. However, as of RDF 1.1 (still in development at the time of writing) this distinction is going away, so going forward you should be able to treat `"Rob Gonzalez"` and `"Rob Gonzalez^^xsd:string` as equivalent, and many tools already do.

The semantics of RDF takes language tags and datatypes into account. This means two things. First, a literal value without either a language tag or datatype is different from a literal with a language tag and is different from a literal with a datatype. These four statements say four different things and none can be inferred from the others:

```
#ahmad foaf:name "ahmad assaf"                   ahmad's name is a lanaguage-less,datatype-less raw text value.
#ahmad foaf:name "ahmad assaf"@en                ahmad's name, in English, is ahmad assaf.
#ahmad foaf:name "ahmed assef"@fr                ahmad's name, in French, is ahmed assef.
#ahmad foaf:name "ahmad assaf"^^xsd:string       ahmad's name is a string.
```

So, an untyped literal with or without a language tag is not the same as a typed literal. The second part of the semantics of literals is that two typed literals that appear different may be the same if their datatype maps their **lexical representations** to the same value. The following statements are equivalent (at least for an RDF application that has been given the semantics of the XSD datatypes):

```
#ahmad ex:age "20"^^xsd:float
#ahmad ex:age "20.000"^^xsd:float
```
